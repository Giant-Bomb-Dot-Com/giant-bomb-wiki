# The Giant Bomb Wiki

We should add stuff here.

For now, you can run the project by populating the .env file and then running `docker compose up -d` then go to http://localhost:8080/w/ in your browser.

## TODO's

- We should probably remove a lot of the stuff in this repo that could be generated/downloaded from MediaWiki via cli. Probably.
- Get started on proof of concept approaches to theming the wiki
- Get started building out some of the complex relationships between categories like we have on the current wiki
